## Hi !

this is the final project of a 3 month training to become a full-stack developer. It is a dynamic, javascript-only progressive-web-app, built in React and Next.js.

you can find it live (functional, but still in construction and just for presenting purposes) at https://projectzero-sable.vercel.app/
